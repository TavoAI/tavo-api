- Create CI/CD integration examples

### 4. Advanced Features

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 2-4 weeks

**Tasks:**

- Design and implement plugin architecture for custom rules
- Implement configuration presets and environment-specific configs
- Add result caching and incremental scanning
- Create IDE integrations (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA)

## Medium Priority Tasks (Future Sprints)

### 5. Quality & Distribution

**Status:** Partial
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Ongoing

**Tasks:**

- Add cross-language integration tests
- Implement performance benchmarking
- Add security testing and validation
- Set up automated publishing to all package registries
- Implement version synchronization across languages

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ **Completed (100%)**

- Python SDK: Full implementation with async client, operations classes, comprehensive tests, proper packaging
- JavaScript/TypeScript SDK: Complete TypeScript implementation, build system, tests, and packaging
- **Java SDK: Complete Maven-based implementation with all operations, comprehensive testing, and documentation**
- **Go SDK: Complete Go module implementation with all operations, testing, and documentation**
- Monorepo Infrastructure: Workspace setup, shared tooling, CI/CD pipelines
- Testing Tools: Mock server for integration testing
- Code Generation & Release Tools: Basic tooling structure

### ❌ **Missing (0%)**

- Examples: Empty directory
- Documentation: Empty directory

## Recommended Development Sequence

1. **Week 1-2:** Build comprehensive documentation and examples (IN PROGRESS)
2. **Week 3-4:** Implement advanced features (plugins, caching, IDE integrations)
3. **Week 5-6:** Quality assurance, cross-language testing, and distribution setup

## Suggested Additional Work

### Performance & Scalability Enhancements

**Connection Pooling & Optimization:**
- Implement HTTP connection pooling for better performance
- Add request/response compression (gzip)
- Implement intelligent retry strategies with exponential backoff
- Add connection timeout and keep-alive configuration

**Async Support:**
- Add async/await support for JavaScript SDK (already has)
- Implement async operations for Java SDK using CompletableFuture
- Add Go SDK with goroutines and channels for concurrent operations

### Developer Experience Improvements

**Code Generation:**
- Create OpenAPI spec from Python SDK for automatic client generation
- Implement SDK generation scripts for new languages
- Add type-safe request builders and response parsers

**IDE Support:**
- Generate language-specific IDE plugins (IntelliSense, auto-completion)
- Create VS Code snippets for common operations
- Add debugging helpers and request/response inspectors

### Enterprise Features

**Advanced Authentication:**
- OAuth 2.0 / OIDC integration
- API key rotation and management
- Multi-tenant organization support
- SAML/SSO integration capabilities

**Compliance & Security:**
- GDPR compliance helpers (data deletion, consent management)
- SOC 2 audit logging
- Encryption at rest for sensitive configurations
- Security scanning integration (SAST/DAST)

### Monitoring & Observability

**Metrics & Telemetry:**
- Request/response metrics collection
- Error rate monitoring and alerting
- Performance benchmarking across SDKs
- Usage analytics and reporting

**Logging & Debugging:**
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- Request/response tracing and correlation IDs
- Debug mode with detailed HTTP logging
- Integration with popular logging frameworks (Log4j, Winston, etc.)

### Testing & Quality Assurance

**Cross-Language Testing:**
- Shared test scenarios across all SDKs
- Multi-language integration test suite
- Performance regression testing
- Compatibility testing with different API server versions

**CI/CD Enhancements:**
- Automated SDK publishing to package registries
- Version synchronization across languages
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated API compatibility testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- Java and Go SDKs are critical for multi-language support
- Without these, the repository cannot fulfill its core purpose
- Documentation is essential for developer adoption

### Medium Risk

- Advanced features may delay initial release but aren't blocking
- Performance optimizations can be added post-MVP

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 4 language SDKs implemented and tested
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for all SDKs
- [ ] Working examples for each language
- [ ] Automated publishing to all package registries
- [ ] Cross-language integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meeting requirements

## Next Steps

1. Begin Java SDK implementation immediately
2. Parallel development of Go SDK
3. Create documentation framework alongside SDK development
4. Set up automated testing pipeline for all languages</content>
