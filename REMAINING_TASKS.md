# Tavo API Repository - Remaining Tasks Summary

## Executive Summary

The tavo-api repository has made excellent progress with Python and JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs fully implemented. However, significant work remains to complete the multi-language SDK vision.

### Completion Status: ~40% (2/5 languages complete)

## Critical Path Tasks (URGENT - Block Release)

### 1. Java SDK Implementation

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Critical
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** Maven, Java 11+

**Tasks:**

- Set up Maven project structure in `packages/java/`
- Implement core API client with authentication
- Add scan operations (create, get, list, results)
- Implement AI analysis operations
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Create unit and integration tests
- Set up Maven build and publishing configuration
- Add Java-specific documentation and examples

### 2. Go SDK Implementation

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Critical
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** Go 1.19+

**Tasks:**

- Set up Go module structure in `packages/go/`
- Implement core API client with authentication
- Add scan operations (create, get, list, results)
- Implement AI analysis operations
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Create unit and integration tests
- Set up Go module publishing
- Add Go-specific documentation and examples

## High Priority Tasks (Next Sprint)

### 3. Documentation & Examples

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

**Tasks:**

- Build Sphinx documentation for Python SDK
- Create TypeDoc documentation for JS/TS SDK
- Add JavaDoc documentation for Java SDK (when complete)
- Create Go documentation (when complete)
- Build unified documentation site
- Create basic usage examples for each language
- Add framework integration examples (Django, Flask, Express, etc.)
- Create CI/CD integration examples

### 4. Advanced Features

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 2-4 weeks

**Tasks:**

- Design and implement plugin architecture for custom rules
- Implement configuration presets and environment-specific configs
- Add result caching and incremental scanning
- Create IDE integrations (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA)

## Medium Priority Tasks (Future Sprints)

### 5. Quality & Distribution

**Status:** Partial
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Ongoing

**Tasks:**

- Add cross-language integration tests
- Implement performance benchmarking
- Add security testing and validation
- Set up automated publishing to all package registries
- Implement version synchronization across languages

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ **Completed (100%)**

- Python SDK: Full implementation with async client, operations classes, comprehensive tests, proper packaging
- JavaScript/TypeScript SDK: Complete TypeScript implementation, build system, tests, and packaging
- Monorepo Infrastructure: Workspace setup, shared tooling, CI/CD pipelines
- Testing Tools: Mock server for integration testing
- Code Generation & Release Tools: Basic tooling structure

### ❌ **Missing (0%)**

- Java SDK: Empty directory
- Go SDK: Empty directory
- Examples: Empty directory
- Documentation: Empty directory

## Recommended Development Sequence

1. **Week 1-2:** Complete Java SDK implementation
2. **Week 3-4:** Complete Go SDK implementation
3. **Week 5-6:** Build comprehensive documentation and examples
4. **Week 7-8:** Implement advanced features (plugins, caching, IDE integrations)
5. **Week 9-10:** Quality assurance, cross-language testing, and distribution setup

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- Java and Go SDKs are critical for multi-language support
- Without these, the repository cannot fulfill its core purpose
- Documentation is essential for developer adoption

### Medium Risk

- Advanced features may delay initial release but aren't blocking
- Performance optimizations can be added post-MVP

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 4 language SDKs implemented and tested
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for all SDKs
- [ ] Working examples for each language
- [ ] Automated publishing to all package registries
- [ ] Cross-language integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meeting requirements

## Next Steps

1. Begin Java SDK implementation immediately
2. Parallel development of Go SDK
3. Create documentation framework alongside SDK development
4. Set up automated testing pipeline for all languages</content>
